## Day5 - REST API Design


### Outline
1. Introduction to REST API
	- [ ] Overview of REST principles
	- [ ] Benefits of REST architecture
	- [ ] Key concepts (resources, representations, stateless communication)
2. HTTP Basics
	- [ ] Understanding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
	- [ ] Status codes and their meanings
	- [ ] Request and response headers
	- [ ] URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) structure
3. Designing Resources
	- [ ] Identifying resources and their relationships
	- [ ] Resource naming conventions (URL structure)
	- [ ] Versioning resources
	- [ ] Resource representations (JSON, XML, etc.)
4. HTTP Methods and CRUD Operations
	- [ ] Mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations
	- [ ] Best practices for each HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
	- [ ] Handling query parameters and filtering
	- [ ] Pagination and result limiting
5. Request and Response Payloads
	- [ ] Structuring request payloads (POST and PUT)
	- [ ] Handling request validation and error handling
	- [ ] Common response formats and status codes
	- [ ] Content negotiation (Accept and Content-Type headers)
6. Authentication and Authorization
	- [ ] Different types of authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth)
	- [ ] Securing REST APIs with authentication tokens
	- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
	- [ ] Handling authorization errors and access control
7. Error Handling and Status Codes
	- [ ] Common error scenarios and status codes
	- [ ] Structuring error responses (error objects)
	- [ ] Error handling strategies (e.g., returning meaningful error messages)
	- [ ] Exception handling and error logging
8. HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
	- [ ] Understanding the concept of HATEOAS
	- [ ] Benefits and challenges of implementing HATEOAS
	- [ ] Designing hypermedia links and resource navigation
9. Documentation and API Standards
	- [ ] Importance of API documentation
	- [ ] Generating API documentation (Swagger, OpenAPI)
	- [ ] API versioning and deprecation policies
	- [ ] Consistency in API design and naming conventions
10. Best Practices and Design Patterns
	- [ ] Keeping APIs simple and intuitive
	- [ ] Designing for extensibility and future changes
	- [ ] Handling API versioning gracefully
	- [ ] Testing and documenting APIs
